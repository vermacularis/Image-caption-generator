4. Image Caption Generator
Objective:
Generate human-like captions for images using Deep Learning.
Tech Stack:
TensorFlow/Keras, CNN (InceptionV3), LSTM, Flickr8k dataset
Description:
The model uses InceptionV3 as an image encoder to extract image features and an LSTM-based decoder to generate textual descriptions. It learns from image-caption pairs and can describe new images with captions like: "A dog playing with a ball in the park."
Key Features:
•	Encoder-Decoder architecture
•	Tokenization and padding for language modeling
•	Beam search for better caption generation
•	Optional UI for image upload and output display
Use Case:
Used in accessibility tools or photo organization apps (e.g., Google Photos).
